# CQRS, N+1, Normalized and/or Denormalized Database Schema?

**Normalized? Denormalized? Projection Builder?**
What are these things anyway?
Are they useful for side projects? For real-world systems?
Do I _actually_ need to care about this when building applications? 🤔

Can’t I just use those new **blazingly fast ORMs**?
TypeORM? Sequelize? Prisma? Drizzle ORM?
Oh wait — Drizzle is faster than Prisma, right?
Can’t I just pick a fast ORM and let it magically make my queries fast without thinking too much about database design? 🤨

Let’s pause right there.

Even though modern ORMs do a _great_ job improving developer experience, **they cannot save a database schema that’s out of shape**.

We should **not** think like this:

> **“We use Prisma / Sequelize / Drizzle, so performance is handled.”**

Because in reality:

- ORMs can **hide N + 1 queries**
- ORMs can generate **inefficient SQL**
- Clean-looking code can still be **very slow**

## “We’re a small team, it’s fine” (famous last words)

If you’re in a small team (like me), an escape thought usually pops up:

> “We’re small, the data is small, we don’t need to worry about scalability, security, or storage yet.
> It works fine. Let’s not overengineer.”

And honestly?
I **agree** with part of that.

- Premature optimization _is_ the root of all evil
- Overengineering _is_ bad
- “Keep it simple” is generally the right instinct

But when it comes to **database schema design**, there’s one thing worth remembering:

> **“Small data” does NOT mean “safe design.”**

You don’t need to overengineer,
but you _should_ design your schema **intentionally**.

## So… what are these things actually?

Let’s break them down.

---

## Normalization

**Normalization ensures correctness, not performance.**

It’s the process of organizing data to:

- Reduce duplication
- Improve data integrity
- Make relationships explicit

In practice, this means:

- Splitting data into multiple related tables
- Each table has a clear responsibility

Example (simplified):

- `posts`
- `tags`
- `comments`
- join tables like `post_tags`

This makes the data:

- Cleaner
- Safer
- Easier to reason about
- Easier to update correctly

This is what databases are _really_ good at.

## Denormalization

**Denormalization is about performance and simplicity.**

It’s the process of:

- Combining data from multiple tables
- Storing it in a shape that’s easy and fast to read

Developers love this because:

- Queries are simpler
- Fewer JOINs
- Faster APIs
- Cleaner frontend code

But denormalization comes with a cost:

- Data duplication
- Risk of inconsistency if done incorrectly

So… should we just denormalize everything?

Not quite.

## The problem: normalized tables are painful to read from

Let’s say we have:

- posts
- tags
- categories
- comments

Schema (simplified):

```text
posts
tags
categories
comments

post_tags        (post_id, tag_id)
post_categories  (post_id, category_id)
comments         (id, post_id, body)
```

Now imagine we want:

> “Give me 100 posts, with their tags, categories, and comments.”

If we’re not careful… we hit **N + 1 queries**.

## N + 1 queries (what it actually means)

**N + 1 is not about rows. It’s about queries.**

Example:

```ts
// 1 query
const posts = await db.query(`SELECT * FROM posts LIMIT 100`);

for (const post of posts) {
  // N queries
  post.tags = await db.query(
    `
    SELECT t.*
    FROM tags t
    JOIN post_tags pt ON pt.tag_id = t.id
    WHERE pt.post_id = $1
  `,
    [post.id],
  );
}
```

If:

- N = 100 posts

Then you get:

```text
1 (posts)
+ 100 (tags per post)
= 101 queries
```

### 2N + 1 is even worse

```ts
const posts = await db.query(`SELECT * FROM posts LIMIT 100`);

for (const post of posts) {
  post.tags = await db.query(`... WHERE post_id = $1`, [post.id]);
  post.categories = await db.query(`... WHERE post_id = $1`, [post.id]);
}
```

Now it’s:

```text
1 (posts)
+ N (tags)
+ N (categories)
= 2N + 1 queries
```

This grows **linearly with data**, which is terrible for scalability.

## “But my ORM code looks clean!”

Yep — that’s the trap.

### Prisma example

```ts
const posts = await prisma.post.findMany();

for (const post of posts) {
  const tags = await prisma.tag.findMany({
    where: { posts: { some: { postId: post.id } } },
  });
}
```

### Drizzle example

```ts
const posts = await db.select().from(postsTable);

for (const post of posts) {
  const tags = await db
    .select()
    .from(postTags)
    .where(eq(postTags.postId, post.id));
}
```

Looks fine.
Reads nicely.

Still N + 1.

> **N + 1 is sneaky because it looks innocent.**

## How do people usually fix this?

There’s no silver bullet, but here are the common approaches.

---

## 1. Batch fetching + merge in memory (most common)

Instead of querying per post, fetch everything **in batches**.

```ts
const posts = await db.query(`SELECT * FROM posts LIMIT 100`);
const postIds = posts.map((p) => p.id);

const tags = await db.query(
  `
  SELECT pt.post_id, t.*
  FROM post_tags pt
  JOIN tags t ON t.id = pt.tag_id
  WHERE pt.post_id = ANY($1)
`,
  [postIds],
);
```

Then group and merge in memory.

### Prisma (eager loading)

```ts
const posts = await prisma.post.findMany({
  include: {
    tags: true,
    categories: true,
    comments: true,
  },
});
```

### Drizzle (manual batching)

```ts
const posts = await db.select().from(postsTable);
const postIds = posts.map((p) => p.id);

const tags = await db
  .select()
  .from(postTags)
  .where(inArray(postTags.postId, postIds));
```

This works well for many cases, but it’s not always enough.

## 2. JOINs

For simple cases (one-to-one, many-to-one), JOINs are great.

```sql
SELECT p.*, t.*, c.*
FROM posts p
LEFT JOIN tags t ON t.post_id = p.id
LEFT JOIN categories c ON c.post_id = p.id;
```

But:

- Too many JOINs
- Cross filtering
- Pagination

👉 This quickly becomes painful.

Pagination over joined data is **notoriously hard**.

## 3. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

This is where things get interesting.

### The idea is simple:

- **Writes need correctness**
- **Reads need speed and simplicity**

Trying to use **one schema for both** causes:

- Too many JOINs
- N + 1 problems
- Slow queries
- Messy code

So CQRS separates them.

### How CQRS helps

- Write to **normalized tables** (source of truth)
- Read from **denormalized tables** (UI-friendly)
- Keep them in sync using a **projection builder**

The projection builder:

- Listens for changes
- Rebuilds read models
- Can be async, event-driven, or cron-based

This gives you:

- Fast reads
- Clean writes
- No N + 1 issues
- Better scalability

### But should everyone use CQRS?

Short answer: **hell no**.

Because it adds:

- More moving parts
- More complexity
- More things to maintain

I personally love this approach because it scales extremely well long-term,
but I **would not recommend it for every project**.

Use it when:

- Reads become complex
- Performance actually hurts
- You _clearly_ feel the pain

## 4. Caching (last layer)

Caching is a **system-level optimization**.

Use it when:

- Your schema is already solid
- Queries are already optimized
- You genuinely need extra speed

Caching bad queries just hides problems.

## Final takeaway

- **Normalize for correctness**
- **Denormalize for performance**
- **Use projections when reads become painful**
- **There is no silver bullet — choose what fits your budget, team size, resources, and use cases**

Start simple.
Evolve intentionally.

Don’t bring big-tech architecture into a tiny project that may never grow.
But also don’t ignore real problems when they show up.

And when N + 1 appears:

1. Try batching + merging in memory
2. Try better queries or JOINs
3. If it’s still messy — CQRS is waiting for you 😉
